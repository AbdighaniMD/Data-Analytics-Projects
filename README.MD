# **Data Analytics - Real World Hands-on Projects** 

**SKILL:**
Utilize Python libraries such as Pandas and Matplotlib to perform advanced data analysis

## setting up Locally

```bash
  python -m venv venv
```

Activating the virtual enviroments on windows

```bash
  venv\Scripts\activate
```

Python Packaging - jupyter Notebook Setup

```bash
  pip install wheel
```

```bash
  pip install pandas jupyter
```

```bash
  pip install jupyterthemes
```

```bash
  jt -t onedork -f roboto -cellw 95%
```

### Some examples of commands used in these projects are :

- __head()__ - It shows the first N rows in the data (by default, N=5).

- __shape__ - It shows the total no. of rows and no. of columns of the dataframe

- __index__ - This attribute provides the index of the dataframe

- __columns__ - It shows the name of each column

- __dtypes__ - It shows the data-type of each column

- __unique()__ - In a column, it shows all the unique values. It can be applied on a single column only, not on the whole dataframe.

- __nunique()__ - It shows the total no. of unique values in each column. It can be applied on a single column as well as on the whole dataframe.

- __count__ - It shows the total no. of non-null values in each column. It can be applied on a single column as well as on the whole dataframe.

- __value_counts__ - In a column, it shows all the unique values with their count. It can be applied on a single column only.

- __info()__ - Provides basic information about the dataframe.* size - To show No. of total values(elements) in the dataset.

- __duplicated()__ - To check row wise and detect the Duplicate rows.

- __isnull()__ - To show where Null value is present.

- __dropna()__ - It drops the rows that contains all missing values.

- __isin()__ - To show all records including particular elements.

- __str.contains()__ - To get all records that contains a given string.

- __str.split()__ - It splits a column's string into different columns.

- __to_datetime()__ - Converts the data-type of Date-Time Column into datetime[ns] datatype.

- __dt.year.value_counts()__ - It counts the occurrence of all individual years in Time column.

- __groupby()__ - Groupby is used to split the data into groups based on some criteria.

- __sns.countplot(df['Col_name'])__ - To show the count of all unique values of any column in the form of bar graph.

- __max(), min()__ - It shows the maximum/minimum value of the series

- __mean()__ - It shows the mean value of the series.
